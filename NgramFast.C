/*
 * Rules:
 * 1) No global variables. Any data structure that you need to add must be
 *    added to the class declaration in NgramFast.h
 * 2) You can add one or two new classes if you like. However, it is certainly
 *    possible and easier to just modify this class. Take a look at how a 
 *    data structure is used in NgramSlow.  That's the wrong data structure for
 *    the problem, but it does show how a type can be defined and used in
 *    the class.
 * 3) No functions.  You can add methods to the Ngrams class, but you can
 *    not add functions that are not within the class.
 * 4) No use of the C++ standard template library, except for the WordList class.
 *    You don't need to modify the WordList class so that it doesn't use the
 *    standard template library.
